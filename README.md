# 📊 Performance Analysis – Monolith vs Microservices

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** presenting a performance comparison between **monolithic** and **microservices** architectures. The analysis was conducted as part of my master's thesis project.

## 📘 Contents

- 📈 Load testing results (NBomber)
- 📊 Metrics analyzed:
  - Requests per second (RPS)
  - Latency (avg, min, max, weighted mean)
- 📉 Visualizations (bar charts)
- 🧠 Conclusions based on test outcomes

## 🔍 Purpose

The notebook was created to compare the **runtime characteristics** of the two architectural approaches using four key use cases from a backend conference management system.

Performance was measured under controlled load to evaluate:
- System throughput
- Responsiveness
- Error tolerance
